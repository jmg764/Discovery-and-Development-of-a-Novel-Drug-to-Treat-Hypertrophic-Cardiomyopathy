This is the final project for BT-GY 6013 Biotechnology & the Pharmaceutical Industry at NYU Tandon.

Consists of a 50 page proposal for a potential new drug detailing disease pathology, currently available drugs, target identification, lead selection and optimization, as well as in vitro and in vivo efficacy and safety evaluations. Also includes a mock IND application for the FDA outlining manufacturing information, animal toxicology studies, and protocols (e.g. patient criteria, dose schedule, biomarkers) for Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials.
